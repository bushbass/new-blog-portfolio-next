The latest thing I've been live coding is a REST API in Node/Express.

Admittedly, the videos are kind of slow paced because, to be honest, I'm figuring it out as I go!  My goal with this series is to re-record it into more of a formal tutorial on building a REST API.   So, stay tuned for that.  What should I live code next?  React, ES6, something else?  I'd love to hear from you.
