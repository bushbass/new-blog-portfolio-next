I made a series of videos on my [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uN3vYNPEQHI&list=PLNZKugAJepQb3GtrGj1ZyWgc9doK84RDV) channel about the basics of JavaScript. These might not be the best for the total beginner and it's not meant to be a "learn everything about JavaScript deeply" kind of a course. They might be best suited for someone who has started to learn JavaScript and needs a refresher. It goes pretty quickly and it might gloss over a few things. My goal was to get to doing something more useful quickly. I'm pretty sure nobody ever said "The day I knew web development was for me was the day the computer confirmed for me that racecar spelled backward is in fact racecar". I wanted to get to making things actually happen on the page ie. DOM manipulation, event listeners, etc. sooner than later.
