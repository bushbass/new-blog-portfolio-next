#### [Huddle landing page](https://bushbass.github.io/huddle-landing-page-679023/)

This was a project from [www.frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io) The site provides practice challenges that users can work through.  They provide a project brief, style guide, and an image of the design and you have to recreate it yourself.  If you're trying to get out of the tutorial rut but need some inspiration on what to build yourself, this is a great resource.
