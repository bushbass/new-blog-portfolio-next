title: "Migrating this site to Gatsby"

Please see [my new site](https://alex-nielsen-portfolio.netlify.app/) for my portfolio, projects, resume, etc. It is more up to date and a better representation of my abilities. I am currently in the process of creating a new portfolio and blog site with Gatsby. Blog posts and project pages will be generated from markdown files. In the short term, I will be using Gatsby plugins to bring my old blogs from this site as a headless CMS, but in the future, I plan on converting the blog posts from this site to markdown as well so I can remove WordPress altogether.
