In this video, I go over some of the basic concepts and features of the [React JavaScript framework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWfxSrHGZrY).  I cover state and props, components, mapping over an array from state to produce multiple components, and how these ideas are useful.  I use [codesandbo.io](http://codesandbox.io) which introduces viewers to this online coding environment.
