When learning web development, they all tell you to find a problem in your life and create a solution using code to create a great project. Well, I drive for Uber and I wanted to know when most flights would be coming into my local airport. The airport website has listings, but it's a cluttered mess. I wanted something where I could just see at a glance when most flights were coming in. I could not find a public/free API for flight information so I needed to figure out a little bit of web scraping. Code and working example is here: [www.alexnielsen.net/projects/airport-scraper](https://www.alexnielsen.net/projects/airport-scraper/) and I did a video walk-through explaining how the code works here:
