This is just a simple todo app tutorial. I'm only including it here because it is the first time I'm using PostgreSQL. I have used mainly the MERN stack previously. You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D5biUE5ge8">watch the code runthrough</a> but there is no hosting or live demo for this one.
