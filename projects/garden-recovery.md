A single page React app to help with garden recovery at the big box hardware store. When I have to bring in 20 or so pallets of various materials it's easy to lose track of how many of each I've brought in. This allows me to keep track with single button clicks.

I will be adding user authentication next so it can be used by other associates in other stores.
