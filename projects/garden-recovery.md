A single page React app to help with garden recovery at the big box hardware store. When I have to bring in 20 or so pallets of various materials it's easy to lose track of how many of each I've brought in. This allows me to keep track with single button clicks.

Data is persisted in local storage so there is no login. This means your list won't be shared across devices although there is danger of losing your info if you were to clear your local storage for some reason.
