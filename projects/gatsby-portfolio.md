\*\*UPDATE - If you're reading this, this site is no longer a Gatsby site. I rebuilt the site using Next.js in January 2022. The link to the demo with the purple background is the Gatsby site which I left up as a refrence.

The website you are currently viewing is made with Gatsby. The projects pages and blog post pages are generated by Gatsby from Markdown files.
